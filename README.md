# LSB-Steganography

# Steganography Tool Using LSB Technique
**Overview**

This project presents a sophisticated steganography tool implemented in Python, utilising the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. The tool capitalises on the characteristic end-of-file marker (FFD9) in JPEG images to append hidden data. This approach enables the embedding of various forms of data, including text, executables, and even entire images, without perceptible changes to the host image. An intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) facilitates the injection and extraction of hidden content, maintaining the secrecy and integrity of the data.

**Features**:

- Data Embedding: Embed text, executables, or images into JPEG files.
- Data Extraction: Extract the embedded data from the modified image without leaving any trace.
- Imperceptibility: Ensures that changes made to the host image are visually indiscernible.
- User-Friendly GUI: Easy-to-use interface for embedding and extracting data seamlessly.
